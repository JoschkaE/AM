#interpretation
  #the stronger the wind the lower the Ozone pollution, very high significance
  #the higher the temperature the higher the Ozone pollution, very high signicficance
  #the higher the Solar.R the higher the Ozone pollution, high significance
  #unsure how to interpret multiple R^2, but 0.48 or 0.4696 (adjusted) seems not high
